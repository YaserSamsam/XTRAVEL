// In this example, the graph is represented as an adjacency list where 
// each key is a node and the value is an array of its neighboring nodes and the cost to reach them. 
// The distance function calculates the Euclidean distance between two coordinates, you could use
// this function to calculate the distance between each node in your graph.

// Please note that this code is a simple example of how the algorithm can be implemented,
// you might need to adapt this to your specific use case (for example, you might need to 
// use different distance metric or you might have different data structure for coordinates)
